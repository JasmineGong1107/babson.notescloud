# Project Proposal 

## The Big Idea
The premise of the project is to create a notes sharing platform for student from Babson College.
Users can create their accounts, upload, edit and delete notes for the course they take.
Usera also have access to notes that are posted by other students.

This project deploys flask to create a web application.

The minimum viable product of will be a web application that allows users to post notes with their account.

The strech goal of this project will allow users to:
1) update and delete exisiting notes;
2) change profile pictures;
3) optimize web function with pagination;
4) customize web for Babson College;
5) optimize back end Python code structure for future up-scale;
6) use Heroku to deploy the project.
 


## Learning Goals
This is an individual project.
The developer will learn how to use flask in depth to create a web application, which including database construction, user account creation and authentication, to organize and share information.

The developer majors in Computational and Mathematical Finance, which is highly interdisciplinary and requires students to be able to depoly knowledge from all subjects agilely. By creating this program, the developer wishes to help herself and other students. 

Furthermore, the ability to command at least one programing language is crucial for the developer to success in her future study - Financial Engerneering Master- and her future career in financial industry as an analyst.


## Implementation Plan and Project Schedule
This is a last-minute project. Once the developer got her approval from her professor for this project. She started immediately and finished the whole project within six days.
She spend the previous four days creating the web application from the scrath(step 1 - 9) and two days deploying the application to Heroku due to firewall restrictions. The major milestones in the project include:
1) Basic set up with tempaltes
2) Forms and user input
3) Database with Flask-SQLAlchemy
4) User authentication
5) User account and profile picture
6) Create, update and delete notes
7) Pagination
8) Email and password reset
9) Deploy to Heroku


## Risks
1)The developer and users should be aware of the risk that some notes, such as slides from class, might violate copyright issues. User should only update their original work or get permissions from Babson to uploade relative class materials.

2)Users should be aware that this is an external and independent service from existing Babson web products.


## Additional Course Content
1)Flask more in depth
2)Flask-SQLAlchemy for Database Construction
3)Heroku Deployment
