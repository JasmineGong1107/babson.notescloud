<h1>About Page</h1>
<p>This web app is designed by a Babson student who wishes help other Babson students succeed in pursuing their degrees
    efficiently.
</p>
<p>The developer thinks it is time-consuming and costly while looking for study materials from platforms such as course
    hero.</p>
<p>Motivated by Babsonâ€™s entrepreneurial spirit, she decides to be a market breaker: designs a product that disrupts the
    current study resource sharing business model to truly benefit students.</p>
<p>She believes the most efficient way is to check notes and to learn expierience from students who took this class from
    the same professors.</p>
<p>CAUTIOUS: This website abids Babson policies. Students should follow Babson honor code and avoid
    uploading inappropriate content that might violates copyright and intellectual properties of Babson College.</p>
